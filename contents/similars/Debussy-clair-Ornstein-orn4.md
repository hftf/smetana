> A little bit of everything. His language ran the gamut from extremely conventional tonality to the harshest dissonances, and he explored all variations within these extremes according to what he wanted to express, and how.

> In the early works one detects shades of Debussy, Bartók, Hebraic motifs, and popular melodies. The latter works are less ‘kind’ to the performer and audience, plus they are generally longer, more diffuse, and perhaps less disciplined. The musical connections and structure are more difficult to hear.
